Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹,  
My name is ChengZheWu, I graduated with a master degree in Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering from Nation Taiwan University(NTU). In graduate school, I major in Deep Learning, Image Recognition and Computer Vision. My master thesis is Multiview Residual Selective Kernel Networkd for Lung Nodule Classification associated with Texture features. Briefly, I diffieneriated benign nodules from malignant nodules in deep learning method. I built a new model architecture MRSKNet and even extracted the texture features from lung nodule CT images as the input to improve the classification ability.
